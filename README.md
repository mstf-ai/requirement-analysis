## üìò What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the disciplined process of discovering, clarifying, documenting, and validating what a software system must do and under what constraints it must operate. It turns stakeholder needs and business objectives into clear, testable, and prioritized **requirements** that guide design, implementation, and verification.

### Why It Matters in the SDLC
- **Reduces rework & cost:** Fixing a misunderstanding early is far cheaper than changing code late in the lifecycle.
- **Aligns stakeholders:** Creates a shared, unambiguous understanding of scope and success criteria.
- **Guides architecture & design:** Functional needs and quality attributes (e.g., performance, security) shape technical choices.
- **Enables testability:** Well-written requirements become the basis for acceptance tests and QA plans.
- **Controls scope:** A baselined set of requirements plus change control prevents scope creep.

### Goals
- Capture *what* the system must do (not *how*).
- Elicit both **functional** and **non-functional** (quality) requirements.
- Resolve conflicts, close gaps, and remove ambiguity.
- Prioritize requirements to deliver maximum value early.

### Inputs & Outputs
- **Inputs:** Business goals, current workflows, regulations, stakeholder interviews, existing systems.
- **Outputs:**  
  - **SRS** (Software Requirements Specification) or Product Requirements Document  
  - **Use cases / user stories** with acceptance criteria  
  - **Glossary**, **scope statement**, **assumptions/constraints**  
  - **Traceability matrix** (linking requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí tests)

### Core Activities
1. **Elicitation:** Interviews, workshops, observation, document analysis, surveys, prototyping.
2. **Analysis & Modeling:** Use cases, user stories, data models, state diagrams, workflows.
3. **Specification:** Write clear, consistent, testable requirements (avoid ambiguous terms like ‚Äúfast,‚Äù ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù).
4. **Validation & Verification:** Stakeholder reviews, prototypes, and feasibility checks to ensure the ‚Äúright‚Äù requirements are captured and are implementable.
5. **Prioritization & Baselining:** Rank (e.g., MoSCoW: Must/Should/Could/Won‚Äôt) and establish a baseline with change control.
6. **Traceability Management:** Maintain links from requirements to design artifacts, code, and tests.

### Types of Requirements
- **Functional:** Behaviors or capabilities (e.g., ‚ÄúA guest can book a property for selected dates.‚Äù)
- **Non-Functional (Quality Attributes):** Performance, security, availability, usability, accessibility, compliance (e.g., ‚ÄúSearch results return within 300 ms for 95% of requests.‚Äù)
- **Constraints:** Technology, regulatory, budget, timeline (e.g., ‚ÄúUse PostgreSQL,‚Äù ‚ÄúGDPR compliance.‚Äù)

### Writing Good Requirements (Checklist)
- **Clear & unambiguous:** Single interpretation.
- **Atomic:** One requirement = one need.
- **Testable:** Has measurable acceptance criteria.
- **Necessary & feasible:** Supports a goal and can be built.
- **Consistent:** No conflicts with others.
- **Traceable:** Has a unique ID and links to tests/design.

**Example (User Story + Acceptance Criteria):**  
- *As a guest, I want to filter properties by price range so that I can find stays within my budget.*  
  - Given the listings page, when I set a minimum and maximum price and click Apply, then only properties with nightly price within that range are shown.  
  - If no results match, a friendly ‚ÄúNo results‚Äù message is displayed.

### Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
- **Vague terms** ‚Üí Replace with measurable criteria.
- **Jumping to solutions** ‚Üí Focus on *what* before *how*.
- **Missing stakeholders** ‚Üí Map roles early; include operations, compliance, and support.
- **Scope creep** ‚Üí Baseline + change control.
- **Poor prioritization** ‚Üí Use MoSCoW/WSJF to maximize value delivery.

## üåü Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Without it, projects risk failing due to unclear goals, wasted resources, and unmet stakeholder expectations. Below are key reasons why Requirement Analysis is essential:

1. **Prevents Misunderstandings and Rework**  
   By clearly defining what the system must do, Requirement Analysis eliminates ambiguity and ensures all stakeholders share the same vision. This reduces costly rework caused by unclear or misunderstood requirements later in development.

2. **Guides Design and Development**  
   Requirements act as a blueprint for developers, architects, and testers. Well-defined requirements provide clarity on scope and functionality, ensuring that design decisions and implementation efforts align with business goals.

3. **Improves Quality and Testability**  
   Clear, testable requirements allow QA teams to design accurate test cases and validation checks. This ensures the final product meets user needs, complies with standards, and delivers expected performance.

4. **Manages Scope and Resources Effectively**  
   Requirement Analysis helps control scope creep by setting boundaries and prioritizing features. This ensures that time, budget, and resources are allocated efficiently to deliver maximum value.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure the software product meets business goals and user needs. The five key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial information about the project from stakeholders, clients, users, and existing systems. This step ensures all possible needs are captured.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Engaging stakeholders through techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to uncover both explicit and hidden requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording the gathered requirements in a clear, structured format (e.g., Software Requirement Specification ‚Äì SRS). Documentation acts as a reference for the entire team.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining requirements to identify conflicts, dependencies, or gaps. Using models such as use-case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or prototypes to visualize requirements for better understanding.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Verifying that requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with business goals. This step ensures stakeholders agree on the documented requirements before moving into design and development.
  

6. **Strengthens Stakeholder Alignment**  
   Involving stakeholders in the requirement analysis process builds trust and alignment. It ensures their needs are properly captured, validated, and agreed upon before development begins.

> **In summary:** Requirement Analysis is the foundation for project success. It ensures the right product is built, within budget and time, while meeting stakeholder expectations.

## üìå Types of Requirements  

In software development, requirements are broadly classified into two categories: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential for building a complete and reliable system.  

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements  
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**. They describe the features, behaviors, and interactions of the system with its users and environment.  

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**  
- Users should be able to **create an account** and log in securely.  
- The system should allow users to **search for available properties** based on location, price, and dates.  
- Users should be able to **book a property** and receive a confirmation via email.  
- Property owners should be able to **list new properties** with details such as description, pricing, and availability.  
- The system should allow users to **cancel bookings** and process refunds when applicable.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements  
Non-functional requirements specify **how the system should perform** rather than what it should do. They define the system‚Äôs quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and scalability.  

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**  
- The system should support **at least 10,000 concurrent users** without downtime.  
- **Response time** for search queries should be less than 2 seconds.  
- The system must comply with **GDPR** for data privacy and security.  
- The application should be **mobile-responsive** and work across different browsers.  
- All transactions must be **encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols**.

## üé≠ Use Case Diagrams  

**Use Case Diagrams** are a visual way of representing how users (actors) interact with a system. They show the different roles in a system and the various functionalities (use cases) that these roles can perform.  

### üìå Benefits of Use Case Diagrams  
- Provide a **clear understanding** of user interactions with the system.  
- Help in identifying **system boundaries** and user roles.  
- Act as a **communication bridge** between stakeholders and developers.  
- Serve as a **blueprint for functional requirements**.  

### üìä Example: Booking Management System  

The diagram below illustrates the main actors and use cases of the booking system.  

**Actors:**  
- User (Guest/Customer)  
- Property Owner  
- Admin  

**Use Cases:**  
- Create Account / Login  
- Search Properties  
- Book Property  
- Make Payment  
- Cancel Booking  
- Add / Manage Property (Owner)  
- Approve Listings (Admin)
